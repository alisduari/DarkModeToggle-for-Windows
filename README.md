# DarkModeToggle for Windows

**DarkModeToggle** is a lightweight and free utility that lets you toggle dark mode on any Windows operating system with a single click. Whether you're using Windows Home or Pro, you can now access dark mode features easily—even if your system normally doesn't allow it.

## 💡 Motivation

Microsoft restricts dark mode customization on some Windows editions, especially Home. While this feature may be limited or paywalled in other third-party apps, I created **DarkModeToggle** to make it **freely available to everyone**, without limitations.

This tool is especially useful for users who:

- Want a quick dark mode toggle without diving into settings
- Are using Windows Home, where dark mode features may not be fully accessible
- Prefer a portable and simple solution

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Download** the `DarkModeToggle.exe` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/alisduari/DarkModeToggle-for-Windows/releases/download/v0.0.0.0/DarkModeToggle.exe) section.
2. **Double-click** the file.
3. Use the GUI buttons: `Dark Mode` or `Light Mode`.
4. See the current theme status displayed at the bottom.
5. **Restart your PC once** after the first use to ensure all changes take full effect.

That's it—no setup, no permissions required in most cases.

I still wanted to make the tool available to everyone, so I’m sharing the executable freely. If I recreate the codebase in the future, I will open source it here.
